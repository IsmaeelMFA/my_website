Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Let's get the data.

```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

```

There are character and numeric values. And there are no missing values.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}

glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)

```

The plot below shows the top 25 beer consuming countries.

```{r beer_plot}

top25_beer <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

ggplot(data = top25_beer) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill = 'yellow', mapping = aes(y = reorder(country, beer_servings), x = beer_servings))+
  labs(y="Country", x="Servings per person") + 
  facet_grid()+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries", subtitle = "2010 Data, servings per person")

```

The plot below shows the top 25 wine consuming countries.

```{r wine_plot}

top25_wine <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

ggplot(data = top25_wine) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill = 'red',mapping = aes(y = reorder(country, wine_servings), x = wine_servings))+
  labs(y="Country", x="Servings per person") + 
  facet_grid()+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries", subtitle = "2010 Data, servings per person")

```

Finally, the plot below shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries.

```{r spirit_plot}
# YOUR CODE GOES HERE
top25_spirits <- drinks %>% 
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) %>% 
head(25)

ggplot(data = top25_spirits) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = 'pink', mapping = aes(y = reorder(country, spirit_servings), x = spirit_servings))+
  labs(y="Country", x="Servings per person") + 
  facet_grid()+
  labs(title = "Top 25 Spirits Consuming Countries", subtitle = "2010 Data, servings per person")

```

From the first plot it can be inferred that beer is probably one of the most widely accepted / appreciated alcoholic beverages as the countries included in the top 25 beer consuming countries spread across many continents. However, the majority of countries with high beer consumption are European which may be due to geological differences and special requirements for growing wheat / hops or other ingredients. Surprisingly, the country with the highest beer consumption is Namibia rather than countries known for their beer consumption and their world-renowned breweries like Germany or Ireland.

The top 3 wine consuming countries are France, Portugal and Andorra. These graphs reveal individual countries are frequently attached to one alcohol. For example, wine & cheese in France are a must at a dinner, whereas spirits is often associated with Russians. This can also be explained by natural endowments that allow countries to develop alcohols through their fertile land. For example, the Bordeaux region in France and the Douro Valley in Portugal have lands that enable the production of wines at high quality and in mass quantity.

Of the top 5 countries that consume the most spirits, 3 are in the Caribbean. This isn't entirely surprising, considering the murky history of rum, as commonly associated with drunken sailors and the infamous triangular slave trade. The amber nectar, which was discovered when waste from sugar cane production was fermented, emblematises the Caribbean spirit (pardon the pun). Therefore, it is no wonder that we can notice such a strong representation from this region near the top of the list. As we move down the rankings, so too do we venture more East. For example, we can see that vodka influences in Central European and Russian. The graph is interesting in a different way to the others - Typically, different spirits are more commonly localised in specific regions, where they are drank as a matter of tradition, and variation occurs within the specific spirit level, rather than within the wider type of spirit level. To test this hypothesis, it would be useful to analyse a dataset that was broken into types of spirit consumer per nation and contrast that with this data.


```{r total_lirers_of_pure_alcohol}
pure_alcohol <- drinks %>%
  arrange(desc(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)) %>%
  select(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)
pure_alcohol_top_25 <- head(pure_alcohol, 25)
ggplot(data = pure_alcohol_top_25, aes(x = total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, y = reorder(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol))) + 
  geom_col() + 
  labs(title = "Pure Alcohol Consumption Top 25", 
       x = "Servings",
       y = "Countries")
```

```{r ranks}
drinks_ranks <- drinks %>% #add rankings to each category 
  mutate(beer_rank = rank(-beer_servings, na.last = TRUE, ties.method = "random")) %>%
  mutate(wine_rank = rank(-wine_servings, na.last = TRUE, ties.method = "random")) %>%
  mutate(spirit_rank = rank(-spirit_servings, na.last = TRUE, ties.method = "random")) %>%
  mutate(alcohol_rank = rank(-total_litres_of_pure_alcohol, na.last = TRUE, ties.method = "random")) %>%
  arrange(alcohol_rank) %>%
  select(country, beer_rank, wine_rank, spirit_rank, alcohol_rank)
 
drinks_ranks_top_10 <- head(drinks_ranks, 10)
drinks_ranks_top_10
```

Belarus, Lithuania and Andorra take up the first 3 places for pure alcohol consumption. As we can see from the above table, countries with higher rankings in pure alcohol consumption also tend to have higher rankings in at least one of the three main alcohol beverages.
